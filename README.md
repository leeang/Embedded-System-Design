- A phase-shift oscillator converts actual temperature into frequency
- Arduino measures frequency and computes the corresponding temperature
- A solid-state H bridge controls the current (amplitude and direction) flowing through a TEC
- The desired temperature is set via a infra-red remote
- The observed temperature shows on the LCD screen

###"Swipe the Arrows" folder has following functions:
* Button  
* Backlight with PWM (adjust luminance by pressing button B)  
* LCD  
* Interrupt (button & timer)  
* Analog-to-digital conversion  
* Low power LED  
* FRAM  
* Game (swipe the arrows, restart by pressing button A)  
* USART Transmit (char & string)  

###"Frame buffer" folder has following functions:
* Button  
* Backlight with PWM (adjust luminance by pressing button B)  
* LCD  
* Interrupt (button)  
* Frame buffer  
* Game (draw picture, toggle 'keep pixel' by pressing button A)
