####Lecture 11 Finding Componets

**Q1**  
Ensure shortest possible return path for signals.

**Q2**  
A signal travelling down an unterminated wire will reflect doubling the voltage on the way back.  
By matching the impedance of your track with the input impedance of the device, these reflections can be eliminated. (often with the help of a termination resistor)

**Q3**  
In order to optimize PCB layout.
